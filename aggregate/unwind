//$unwind operator to deconstruct the “model_year” array field and to create separate documents for each year.

//if a non-array field is defined as the path in the $unwind operator, 
//it would have resulted in an error. From MongoDB 3.2 onwards, 
//any non-array field which does not resolve to a missing, null, or empty array will be treated as a single element array.
